#       abstract: "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are able to leverage the structure of graph data by passing messages along the edges of the graph. While this allows GNNs to learn features depending on the graph structure, for certain graph topologies it leads to inefficient information propagation and a problem known as oversquashing. This has recently been linked with the curvature and spectral gap of the graph. On the other hand, adding edges to the message-passing graph can lead to increasingly similar node representations and a problem known as oversmoothing. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm that prevents oversquashing by systematically adding edges to the graph based on spectral expansion. We combine this with a relational architecture, which lets the GNN preserve the original graph structure and provably prevents oversmoothing. We find experimentally that our algorithm outperforms existing graph rewiring methods in several graph classification tasks. This is work with Kedar Karhadkar and Pradeep Kr. Banerjee."

      title: "Geometric Algebra Transformers: A Universal Architecture for Geometric Data"
      abstract: "Problems involving geometric data arise in a variety of fields, including computer vision, robotics, chemistry, and physics. Such data can take numerous forms, such as points, direction vectors, planes, or transformations, but to date there is no single architecture that can be applied to such a wide variety of geometric types while respecting their symmetries. In this paper we introduce the Geometric Algebra Transformer (GATr), a general-purpose architecture for geometric data. GATr represents inputs, outputs, and hidden states in the projective geometric algebra, which offers an efficient 16-dimensional vector space representation of common geometric objects as well as operators acting on them. GATr is equivariant with respect to Pin(3,0,1), the double cover of E(3): the symmetry group of 3D Euclidean space. As a transformer, GATr is scalable, expressive, and versatile. In various geometric problems, GATr shows strong improvements over non-geometric baselines."

      title: "Is it the network, or is it the data? Towards large-scale PDE surrogates"
      abstract: "Partial differential equations (PDEs) see widespread use in sciences and engineering to describe simulation of physical processes interacting and coevolving over time. Due to the computationally expensive nature of their standard solution methods, neural PDE surrogates have become an active research topic to accelerate these simulations. In this talk, we approach such surrogates from two different angles. First, we have a closer look into possible ideas to best integrate physics into neural PDE surrogates. Second, we let known tricks from computer vision and the pure power of the data speak and assume that all the physics is in the data. Especially for the second, the model needs to be designed in a way to leverage it all. Finally, we compare these paradigms against each other and give an outlook."

      title: "Scaling Unlocks Emergent Abilities In Language Models"
      abstract: "Scaling up language models has been shown to predictably improve performance on a wide range of downstream tasks. In this talk, we will instead discuss an unpredictable phenomenon that we refer to as emergent abilities of large language models. An ability is considered emergent if it is not present in smaller models but is present in larger models, which means that the ability cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models. With the popularization of large language models such as GPT-3, Chinchilla, and PaLM, dozens of emergent abilities have been discovered, including chain-of-thought prompting, which enables state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning, and instruction finetuning, which enables large language models to be usable by the broader population. The existence of such emergent phenomena raises the question of whether additional scaling could potentially further expand the range of capabilities of language models."
      bio: "Jason Wei is an AI researcher working on ChatGPT at OpenAI in San Francisco. He was previously a senior research scientist at Google Brain, where he popularized chain-of-thought prompting, co-led the first efforts on instruction tuning, and wrote about emergence in large language models.

      abstract: "Diffusion models have demonstrated amazing abilities for image and video generation. In this talk we explain some recent breakthroughs in understanding state-of-the-art diffusion models as infinitely deep variational autoencoders (VAEs). We start by introducing VAEs. Twe then introduce continuous-time diffusion models as infinitely deep VAEs, and how to optimize their evidence lower bound (ELBO). Finally, we present a new result that explains the objective functions used in state-of-the-art (SOTA) diffusion models as the ELBO with simple data augmentation. This opens up new avenues for optimizing other model families with the same objective as successful diffusion models. We will list some interesting open research questions in the diffusion model space."

      title: "Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality in Generative Modeling: A Homotopic Approach"
      abstract: "Generative modeling for high-dimensional data, such as images and audio, is extremely challenging due to the curse of dimensionality. To overcome this difficulty, I introduce a homotopic approach inspired by numerical equation solving, which involves designing a homotopy of probability distributions that smoothly progresses from simple noise distribution to complex data distribution. I will present two families of approaches that rely on such homotopies: score-based diffusion models and consistency models. Both approaches use a differential equation to convert data to noise and learn to estimate the time reversal with deep neural networks. These models allow for flexible neural networks, enable zero-shot image editing, and generate high-quality samples that achieve state-of-the-art performance in many generative modeling benchmarks."

      title: "Reasoning Algorithmically: from Toy Experiments to AGI Modules"
      abstract: "Neural networks that are able to reliably execute algorithmic computation may hold transformative potential to both machine learning and theoretical computer science. On one hand, they could enable the kind of extrapolative generalisation scarcely seen with deep learning models. On another, they may allow for running classical algorithms on inputs previously considered inaccessible to them. Over the past few years, the pace of development in this area has gradually become intense. As someone who has been very active in its latest incarnation, I have witnessed these concepts grow from isolated 'toy experiments', through NeurIPS spotlights, all the way to helping detect patterns in complicated mathematical objects (published on the cover of Nature) and supporting the development of generalist reasoning agents. In this talk, I will give my personal account of this journey, and especially how our own interpretation of this methodology, and understanding of its potential, changed with time. It should be of interest to a general audience interested in graphs, (classical) algorithms, reasoning, and building intelligent systems."

      title: "Deep Learning After the Transformer"
      abstract: "The field of machine learning has been through several exciting moments – kernel methods, Bayesian inference, non-parametric methods, to name a few. Every time a new approach pushed an existing limit, people wondered if the approach was “the best”. In our time of 2023, the Transformer is prevalent. Hardly can one find a research paper that does not mention this immensely successful model. But is the Transformer the best neural architecture? If so, can we explain why? If not, how can we improve it; more ambitiously, how can we make something better than it? In this talk, I invite you to contemplate these questions. I share my insights on the properties of the Transformer that make it favorable or not favorable for certain domains and tasks. Based on these insights, I discuss the potential directions for subsequent developments. I will discuss some recent work from my group that makes learning algorithms more efficient, with or without the Transformer."

      title: "Safe Learning-based Control of Mechanical Systems"
      abstract: "In modern technologies such as autonomous vehicles and service robots, control engineering plays a crucial role for the overall performance and safety of the system. However, the control design becomes often very time-consuming or even infeasible due to the increasing complexity of mechanical systems. The classical control approaches, which are based on models of the systems using first principles, are not satisfactory in the presence of complex dynamics, e.g., for highly nonlinear systems or interaction with prior unknown environment. Recent findings in computational intelligence and machine learning have shown that data-driven approaches lead to very promising results in a wide application domain including the modeling of complex dynamics. However, the major drawback in data-driven approaches frequently manifests as unpredictable outcomes. Therefore, the current application of machine learning in control is typically limited to non-critical and low performance systems. In this talk, I will present our results on safe learning-based control of partially unknown mechanical systems. In the first part of the seminar, I will show how we leverage Gaussian processes for the learning of unknown dynamics in the system. Gaussian process (GP) models are of high interest due to many beneficial properties such as the bias-variance trade-off and the strong connection to Bayesian mathematics. We exploit the Bayesian structure to include prior knowledge about the system into the learning process. In the second part, I will present a learning-enhanced model-based control law which guarantees safe control of mechanical systems with partially unknown dynamics. This control law combines the strength of model-based control with the flexibility of machine learning techniques. I demonstrate how we actively exploit the uncertainty of the GP model to guarantee high-performance and stability of the closed-loop."

      title: "Neural-Control Family: Safe Agile Deep-learning-based Robotic Control in Dynamic Environments"
      abstract: "Recent breathtaking advances in machine learning beckon to their applications in a wide range of autonomous systems. However, for safety-critical settings such as agile robotic control in hazardous environments, we must confront several key challenges before widespread deployment. Most importantly, the learning system must interact with the rest of the autonomous system (e.g., highly nonlinear and non-stationary dynamics) in a way that safeguards against catastrophic failures with formal guarantees. In addition, from both computational and statistical standpoints, the learning system must incorporate prior knowledge for efficiency and generalizability. In this talk, I will present progress toward establishing a unified framework that fundamentally connects learning and control. In particular, I will introduce a concrete example in such a unified framework called Neural-Control Family, a family of deep-learning-based nonlinear control methods with not only stability and robustness guarantees but also new capabilities in agile robotic control. For example, Neural-Swarm enables close-proximity flight of a drone swarm and Neural-Fly enables precise drone control in strong time-variant wind conditions."

      title: "Structured Scene Understanding: Objects, Dynamics, 3D"
      abstract: "The world around us — and our understanding of it — is rich in compositional structure: from atoms and their interactions to objects and agents in our environments. How can we learn scalable models of the physical world that capture this structure from raw, unstructured observations? In this talk, I will cover our team’s recent work on structured scene understanding: I will introduce an emergent class of slot-centric neural architectures that use a set of latent variables (“slots”) grounded in the physical scene. Slots are decoupled from the image grid and can learn to capture objects or more fine-grained scene components, model their dynamics, and learn 3D-consistent representations when a scene is observed from multiple viewpoints. I will briefly introduce the Slot Attention mechanism as a core representative for this class of models and cover recent extensions to video (SAVi, SAVi++), 3D (OSRT), and visual dynamics simulation (SlotFormer)."

    - speaker: Brandon Amos, Meta AI
      date: 02/13/2023
      title: "Learning with differentiable and amortized optimization"
      abstract: "Optimization has been a transformative modeling and decision-making paradigm over the past century that computationally encodes non-trivial reasoning operations.  Developments in optimization foundations alongside domain experts have resulted in breakthroughs for 1) controlling robotic, autonomous, mechanical, and multi-agent systems, 2) making operational decisions based on future predictions, 3) efficiently transporting or matching resources, information, and measures, 4) allocating budgets and portfolios, 5) designing materials, molecules, and other structures, 6) solving inverse problems to infer underlying hidden costs, incentives, geometries, terrains, and other structures, and 7) learning and meta-learning the parameters of predictive and statistical models. These settings often analytically specify the relevant models of the world along with an explicit objective to optimize for. Once these are specified, computational optimization solvers are able to search over the space of possible solutions or configurations and return the best one. The magic of optimization stops when 1) the relevant models of the world are too difficult or impossible to specify, leading to inaccurate or incomplete representations of the true setting, and 2) solving the optimization problem is computationally challenging and takes too long to return a solution on today's hardware. Machine learning methods help overcome both of these by providing fast predictive models and powerful latent abstractions of the world. In this talk, I will cover two ways of tightly integrating optimization and machine learning methods: 1. *Differentiable optimization* characterizes how the solution to an optimization problem changes as the inputs change. In machine learning settings, differentiable optimization provides an implicit layer that integrates optimization-based domain knowledge into the model and enables unknown parts of the optimization problem to be learned. I will cover the foundations of learning these layers with implicit differentiation and highlight applications in robotics and control settings. 2. *Amortized optimization* rapidly predicts approximate solutions to optimization problems and is useful when repeatedly solving optimization problems. Traditional optimization methods typically solve every new problem instance from scratch, ignoring shared structures and information when solving a new instance. In contrast, a solver augmented with amortized optimization learns the shared structure present in the solution mappings and better-searches the domain. I will cover the foundations of amortized optimization and highlight new applications in control and optimal transport."

      title: "Hierarchical and Sequential Perspectives on Sliced Wasserstein Distance"
      abstract: "From its origins in work by Monge and Kantorovich, the Wasserstein distance has played an important role in the theory of mathematics. In the current era, the strong and increasing connection between optimization and machine learning has brought new applications of the Wasserstein distance to the fore. In these applications, the focus is on learning the probability distributions underlying the Wasserstein distance formulation. However, the Wasserstein distance has been known to suffer from expensive computation and the curse of dimensionality. It creates several hurdles of using the Wasserstein distance in statistical machine-learning applications. A well-known approach to overcome the statistical and computational limits of the Wasserstein distance is by projecting the probability distributions into the one-dimensional manifold, which refers to as the sliced Wasserstein distance. The sliced Wasserstein distance leverages the closed-form expression of the Wasserstein distance in one dimension; therefore, its computational complexity is only linear in the number of supports of the probability distributions while the statistical rate is parametric for learning probability distributions. Despite these advantages of the sliced Wasserstein distance, it still suffers from two fundamental challenges in large-scale high dimensional statistical machine learning settings: (1) High projection complexities, namely, the number of projections to approximate the value of the sliced Wasserstein distance is huge and scales with the dimension of the problem; (2) Uninformative projecting directions, namely, there are several redundant projections to approximate the value of the sliced Wasserstein distance In this talk, we propose two fundamental approaches to tackle the above challenges of the sliced Wasserstein distance. Our first approach hierarchically projects probability measures into low-dimensional spaces before projecting them into one-dimensional space. The hierarchical projections lead to an improvement in projection complexity and enhance the expressiveness of the projection of the sliced Wasserstein distance. Our second approach considers sequential sampling for projecting directions to allow the sharing of information on new projecting directions based on the previous directions. It increases the quality of projections in terms of highlighting the difference between the probability measures and leads to a smaller number of projections, which improves the computational complexity of the sliced Wasserstein distance."

      title: "Building Blocks of Generalizable Autonomy: Duality of Discovery & Bias"
      abstract: "Generalization in embodied intelligence, such as in robotics, requires interactive learning across families of tasks is essential for discovering efficient representation and inference mechanisms. Concurrent systems need a lot of hand-holding to even learn a single cognitive concept or a dexterous skill, say “open a door”, let alone generalizing to new windows and cupboards! This is far from our vision of everyday robots! would require a broader concept of generalization and continual update of representations. This study of the science of embodied AI opens three key questions: (a) Representational biases & Causal inference for interactive decision-making, (b) Perceptual representations learned by and for interaction, and (c) Systems and abstractions for scalable learning."

      abstract: "Biases in existing training datasets used in algorithmic decision making, which can arise due to, e.g., prior labeling or feature measurement errors, raise ethical and economic concerns due to the resulting disparate treatment of different groups. In this talk, we will first investigate the robustness of a few existing (demographic) fairness criteria when the algorithm is trained on biased data. We show, both analytically and numerically, that some constraints can remain robust when facing certain forms of statistical bias in the training data. I will then briefly talk about an algorithm for sequential debiasing of such datasets through adaptive and bounded exploration. This is joint work with Yiqiao Liao, Yifan Yang, and Yang Liu."

      title: "Statistical and Computational Aspect of Sliced Optimal Transport"
      abstract: "As machine learning/inference tasks boil down to comparing or transforming complicated probability distributions, optimal transport (OT) theory---which provides a potent framework for doing so---has emerged as a tool of choice for design and analysis. Its adoption was driven by an array of favorable properties, including robustness to support mismatch, a powerful duality theory, and the Wasserstein metric it defines on the space of probability measures, which endows it with a rich geometry. Alas, statistical OT is bottlenecked by the curse of dimensionality, whereby quantitative results either deteriorate exponentially with dimension or are largely unavailable (e.g., limit theorems, resampling, efficiency). In turn, resulting performance bounds for OT-based learning methods are often vacuous or, worse yet, missing. Slicing is a modern regularization technique by which one computes the average/maximized OT distance between different low-dimensional projections of the high-dimensional distributions. This framework inherits many structural properties of classical OT but alleviates the empirical curse of dimensionality. This talk will present recent advancements in the statistical and computational analysis of sliced OT methods. We will cover fast empirical convergence rates, high-dimensional limit distribution theorems, as well as formal guarantees for computational methods such as Monte Carlo integration (for average-slicing) and projected subgradient methods (for max-slicing). Applications to implicit generative modeling will be discussed and serve to motivate the statistical exploration."

      title: "Coresets for Efficient and Robust Learning from Massive Datasets"
      abstract: "Large datasets have been crucial to the success of modern machine learning models. However, training on massive data has two major limitations. First, it is contingent on exceptionally large and expensive computational resources, and incurs a substantial cost due to the significant energy consumption. Second, in many real-world applications such as medical diagnosis, self-driving cars, and fraud detection, big data contains highly imbalanced classes, noisy labels, and malicious data points. In such cases, training on the entire data does not result in a high-quality model. In this talk, I will argue that we can address the above limitations by developing techniques that can identify and extract the most informative subsets for learning from massive datasets. Training on such subsets not only reduces the substantial costs of learning from big data, but also improves their accuracy and robustness against noisy labels and data poisoning attacks. I will discuss how we can develop effective and theoretically rigorous techniques that provide strong guarantees for the learned models’ quality and robustness against noisy labels."

It leads to efficient tools to represent complex objects and scenes in the 3D world which robots and autonomous vehicles need to interact with. In this talk, I will discuss my group's work on both object-level and scene-level 3D deep learning. At the object level, I will explain FoldingNet (CVPR'18), a 3D point cloud auto-encoder that essentially resembles the paper-folding operations in its lightweight decoder with better shape reconstruction performance. This new decoder can address a challenging robotics task: soft robot proprioception. At the scene level, I will explain DiscoNet (NeurIPS'21), an efficient collaborative perception method using a dynamic directed graph with matrix-valued edge weights for an ego-vehicle to adaptively retrieve the most important complementary information from its neighboring vehicles. This could improve LiDAR-based perception's performance and robustness in self-driving against challenges such as data sparsity and occlusions.

Despite significant progress in the modern machine learning literature, adopting the new approaches has been slow in the biomedical and clinical research communities due to the lack of explainability and limited data. Such challenges present new opportunities to develop novel methods that address AI's unique challenges in medicine. This talk has three parts. In the first part of the talk, I show examples of model explainability (XAI) tailored toward AI in Radiology applications. More specifically, I integrate ideas from causal inference for XAI (e.g., counterfactual, mediation analysis). The second part presents examples of incorporating medical insight for self-supervised learning of imaging phenotype. Finally, I address the issue of partial missingness (a common problem using clinical data) in imaging genetics for statistical independence tests."

      title: "Pitfalls of Saliency Map Interpretation in Deep Neural Networks"
      abstract: " A popular method of interpreting neural networks is to use saliency map representations, which assign importance scores to each input feature of the model. In this talk, I will discuss two of our works that expose pitfalls in these methods. First, we will discuss how existing saliency maps cannot satisfy two desirable properties simultaneously and propose the “full-gradient representation” which avoids these problems. Based on this representation, we propose an approximate saliency method called FullGrad which we find explains model behavior better than competing methods in the literature. Second, we find that a popular saliency map method, the input-gradients, can be arbitrarily structured due to the shift-invariance of SoftMax. We investigate why standard neural network models have input-gradients with interpretable structure even when this is unnecessary, and we find that standard models have an implicit generative modeling component, which is responsible for this behavior. Overall, our works show that interpreting black-box models using off-the-shelf interpretability methods can be risky and must be used with caution. "

      title: "Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM): Current Method and Future Directions"
      abstract: " In today's heavily overparameterized models, the value of the training loss provides few guarantees on model generalization ability. Indeed, optimizing only the training loss value, as is commonly done, can easily lead to suboptimal model quality. Motivated by prior work connecting the geometry of the loss landscape and generalization, we introduce a new and effective procedure for instead simultaneously minimizing loss value and loss sharpness. Our procedure, Sharpness- Aware Minimization (SAM), seeks parameters that lie in neighborhoods having uniformly low loss; this formulation results in a min-max optimization problem on which gradient descent can be performed efficiently. We present empirical results showing that SAM improves model generalization across a variety of benchmark datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, finetuning tasks) and models, yielding novel state-of-the-art performance for several. Additionally, we find that SAM natively provides robustness to label noise on par with that provided by state-of-the art procedures that specifically target learning with noisy labels. Finally, we will discuss possible directions for further research around SAM."

      title: "Resource-efficient Deep Learning: Democratizing AI at Scale"
      abstract: "The phenomenal success of deep learning in the past decade has been mostly driven by the construction of increasingly large deep neural network models. These models usually impose an ideal assumption that there are sufficient resources, including large-scale parameters, sufficient data, and massive computation, for the optimization. However, this assumption usually fails in real-world scenarios. For example, computer memory may be limited as in edge devices, large-scale data are difficult to obtain due to expensive costs and privacy constraints, and computational power is constrained as in most university labs. As a result, these resource discrepancy issues have hindered the democratization of deep learning techniques in many AI applications, and the development of efficient deep learning methods that can adapt to different resource constraints is of great importance. In this talk, I will present my recent research contributions centered around resource-efficient deep learning to free AI from the parameterdata-computation hungry beast. First, I will introduce my contribution on neural network pruning under the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm, which improves the parameter efficiency of large-scale language models in the inference phase, resulting in pruned models with an order-of-magnitude fewer parameters than the original model while achieving the same or better prediction accuracy. Then, I will talk about my task-agnostic neural architecture search framework to reduce the computational cost in the training phase for finding the best-pruned models, which is complementary to improving the parameter efficiency in the inference phase. Finally, I will conclude my presentation with a brief overview of my ongoing and future work as part of a broader research agenda of new and related problems and potential collaborations in the next few years."

Nowadays, it is used in a wide range of highly complex applications such as natural language processing or even scientific applications. Its first major breakthrough, however, was achieved by shattering the state-of-the-art in image classification. We revisit the problem of classification by deep neural networks and attempt to find an answer to why deep networks are remarkably effective in this regime. We will interpret the learning of classifiers as finding piecewise constant functions from labeled samples. We then precisely link the hardness of the learning problem to the complexity of the regions. Concretely, we will establish fundamental lower bounds on the learnability of certain regions. Finally, we will show that in many cases, these optimal bounds can be achieved by deep-neural-network-based learning. In quite realistic settings, we will observe that deep neural networks can learn high-dimensional classifiers without a strong dependence of the learning rates on the dimension."

      abstract: "While deep learning has achieved remarkable computer vision successes, fundamentally both the theory and practice for these successes have relied on vanilla supervised learning where the training and testing datasets both are sampled from the same distribution. In reality, there is likely to be a significant distribution shift once models are deployed, including noise/weather/illumination/modality changes (covariate shift), new categories (semantic shift), or different label distributions. In this talk, I will present our recent work focusing on the fundamental handling of several of these shifts. For label distribution shifts, we propose a posterior-recalibration of classifiers that can be applied without re-training to handle imbalanced datasets. For covariate and semantic shift, we propose a geometric decoupling of classifiers into feature norms and angles, showing that it can be used to learn more sensitive feature spaces for better calibration and out-of-distribution detection. We demonstrate state-of-art results across multiple benchmark datasets and metrics. In the end, I will present connections to a wider set of problems including continual/lifelong learning, open-set discovery, and semi-supervised learning."

      title: "Towards Building a Heavy-Tailed Theory of Stochastic Gradient Descent for Deep Neural Networks"
      abstract: " In this talk, I will focus on the 'tail behavior' of SGD in deep learning. I will first empirically illustrate that heavy tails arise in the gradient noise (i.e., the difference between the stochastic gradient and the true gradient). Accordingly, I will propose to model the gradient noise as a heavy-tailed α-stable random vector and accordingly propose to analyze SGD as a discretization of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by a stable process. As opposed to classical SDEs that are driven by a Brownian motion, SDEs driven by stable processes can incur ‘jumps’, which force the SDE (and its discretization) transition from 'narrow minima' to 'wider minima', as proven by existing metastability theory and the extensions that we proved recently. These results open up a different perspective and shed more light on the view that SGD 'prefers' wide minima. In the second part of the talk, I will focus on the generalization properties of such heavy-tailed SDEs and show that the generalization error can be controlled by the Hausdorff dimension of the trajectories of the SDE, which is closely linked to the tail behavior of the driving process. Our results imply that heavier-tailed processes should achieve better generalization; hence, the tail-index of the process can be used as a notion of capacity metric. Finally, if time permits, I will talk about the 'originating cause' of such heavy-tailed behavior and present theoretical results which show that heavy-tails can even emerge in very sterile settings such as linear regression with i.i.d Gaussian data."
