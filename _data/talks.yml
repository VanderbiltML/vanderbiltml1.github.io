      title: "Towards Building a Heavy-Tailed Theory of Stochastic Gradient Descent for Deep Neural Networks"
      abstract: "Taking stock of ML Infra problems with potential to benefit from systematic analysis. ML currently requires running large amounts experiments to compensate for the lack of analysis. 
Modern AI infrastructure (major clouds) is efficient in creating, training, and deploying thousands of model. 
At the same time, improving production models performance, accurate estimation of models performance in production, web data relevance, risk mitigation - these are ad hoc and experiment-driven processes. 
Analytical analysis for Production [distributed, large-scale, rapidly changing environment] ML can help to direct and hopefully replace the empirical and manual processes."

      title: "What can Data-Centric AI Learn from Data and ML Engineering?"
      abstract: 'Data-centric AI is a new and exciting research topic in the AI community, but many organizations already build and maintain various "data-centric" applications whose goal is to produce high quality data. These range from traditional business data processing applications (e.g., "how much should we charge each of our customers this month?") to production ML systems such as recommendation engines. The fields of data and ML engineering have arisen in recent years to manage these applications, and both include many interesting novel tools and processes. In this talk we present lessons from data and ML engineering that could be interesting to apply in data-centric AI, based on our experience developing data and ML platforms that serve thousands of applications at a range of organizations. In particular, we will discuss lessons related to data monitoring and the challenges to apply it effectively in production ML systems.'

      title: "DeepETA: How Uber Predicts Arrival Times Using Deep Learning"
      abstract: "Estimated
 Time of Arrival (ETA) plays an important role in delivery and ride-hailing platforms. For example, Uber uses ETAs to calculate fares, estimate pickup times, match riders to drivers, plan deliveries, and more. Commonly used route planning algorithms predict
 an ETA conditioned on the best available route, but such ETA estimates can be unreliable when the actual route taken is not known in advance. In this talk, we describe an ETA post-processing system in which a deep residual ETA network (DeepETA) refines naive
 ETAs produced by a route planning algorithm. Offline experiments and online tests demonstrate that post-processing by DeepETA significantly improves upon the accuracy of naive ETAs as measured by mean and median absolute error. We further show that post-processing
 by DeepETA attains lower error than competitive baseline regression models."

      title: "Improving Robustness and Interpretability in Vision and Language Grounding Models"
      abstract: 'Deep neural networks have enabled significant progress on many multi-modal grounding problems such as visual question answering (VQA), referring expression recognition (REF) which has several important applications such as in navigation, medical imaging, robotics and accessibility. In the last few years we have seen a huge improvement in how these models perform, some of them reaching human-level performance on several datasets. However, we find that these models could be exploiting strong biases in these datasets casting doubts on the actual progress. 

      For example, as a human, do you focus on the same visual object when you hear the sentences “the bus in the middle of the crowd” and “the crowd that the bus is in the middle of”? Neural networks do so. The exciting progress on understanding language in the context of an image is not due to the cleverness of the neural networks, but rather because of the shortcuts present in the evaluation datasets. In this talk, we show that state-of-the-art neural network approaches are easily fooled due to their failure in overcoming biases in the training datasets. We also show that the recent self-supervised BERT based multi-modal architectures (e.g. ViLBERT) are relatively more robust compared to other neural architectures. We propose methods to improve robustness (and generalization) of the current models. We show that while data augmentation is one way to increase robustness, multi-task learning is probably a less tedious route. Finally, we describe a mechanism for producing scalable and nonstationary benchmarks (and out-of-distribution hard splits) for testing the generalization capabilities of existing grounding models.'

      title: "Improving Transfer and Robustness of Supervised Contrastive Learning"
      abstract: 'An ideal learned representation should display transferability and robustness. Supervised contrastive learning is a promising method for training accurate models, but produces representations that do not capture these properties due to class collapse -- when all points in a class map to the same representation. In this talk, we discuss how to alleviate these problems to improve the geometry of supervised contrastive learning. We identify two key principles: balancing the right amount of geometric "spread" in the embedding space, and inducing an inductive bias towards subclass clustering. We introduce two mechanisms for achieving these aims in supervised contrastive learning, and show that doing so improves transfer learning and worst-group robustness. Next, we show how we can apply these insights to improve entity retrieval in open-domain NLP tasks (e.g., QA, search). We present a new method, TABi, that trains bi-encoders with a type-aware supervised contrastive loss and improves long-tailed entity retrieval.'

      title: "Learned Indexing and Sampling for Improving Query Performance in Big-Data Analytics"
      abstract: "Traditional data analytics systems improve query efficiency via fine-grained, row-level indexing and sampling techniques. However, to keep up with the data volumes, increasingly many systems store and process datasets in large partitions containing hundreds of thousands of rows. Therefore, these analytics systems must adapt traditional techniques to work with coarse-grained data partitions as a basic unit to process queries efficiently. 
 
      In this talk, I will discuss two related ideas that combine learning techniques with partitioning designs to improve the query efficiency in the analytics systems. First, I will describe PS3, the first approximate query processing system that supports non-uniform, partition-level samples. PS3 reduces the number of partitions accessed by 3 to 70x to achieve the same error compared to a uniform sample of the partitions.  Next, I will present OLO, an online learning framework that dynamically adapts data organization according to changes in query workload to minimize overall data access and movement. We show that dynamic reorganization outperforms a single, optimized partitioning scheme by up to 30% in end-to-end runtime.

      I will conclude by discussing additional open problems in this area."

      title: "Looper: an end-to-end ML platform for product decisions"
      abstract: "Modern software systems and products increasingly rely on machine learning models to make data-driven decisions based on interactions with users, infrastructure and other systems. For broader adoption, this practice must (i) accommodate product engineers without ML backgrounds, (ii) support fine-grain product-metric evaluation and (iii) optimize for product goals. To address shortcomings of prior platforms, we introduce general principles for and the architecture of an ML platform, Looper, with simple APIs for decision-making and feedback collection.
      
      Looper covers the end-to-end ML lifecycle from collecting training data and model training to deployment and inference, and extends support to personalization, causal evaluation with heterogenous treatment effects, and Bayesian tuning for product goals. During the 2021 production deployment Looper simultaneously hosted 440-1,000 ML models that made 4-6 million real-time decisions per second. We sum up experiences of platform adopters and describe their learning curve."

      abstract: "Alpa (https://github.com/alpa-projects/alpa) automates model-parallel training of large deep learning models by generating execution plans that unify data, operator, and pipeline parallelism. Alpa distributes the training of large deep learning models by viewing parallelisms as two hierarchical levels: inter-operator and intra-operator parallelisms. Based on it, Alpa constructs a new hierarchical space for massive model-parallel execution plans. Alpa designs a number of compilation passes to automatically derive the optimal parallel execution plan in each independent parallelism level and implements an efficient runtime to orchestrate the two-level parallel execution on distributed compute devices. Alpa generates parallelization plans that match or outperform hand-tuned model-parallel training systems even on models they are designed for. Unlike specialized systems, Alpa also generalizes to models with heterogeneous architectures and models without manually-designed plans."

      title: Scaling Multilingual Machine Translation to Thousands of Language Directions
      abstract: "Existing work in translation has demonstrated the potential of massively multilingual machine translation by training a single model able to translate between any pair of languages. However, much of this work is English-Centric by training only on data which was translated from or to English. While this is supported by large sources of training data, it does not reflect translation needs worldwide. In this talk, I will describe how we create a true Many-to-Many multilingual translation model that can translate directly between any pair of 100 languages. We build and open source a training dataset that covers thousands of language directions with supervised data, created through large-scale mining. Then, we explore how to effectively increase model capacity through a combination of dense scaling and language-specific sparse parameters to create high quality models. Our focus on non-English-Centric models brings gains of more than 10 BLEU when directly translating between non-English directions while performing competitively to the best single systems of WMT."

      title: Tiny Machine Learning
      abstract: "Tiny machine learning (TinyML) is a fast-growing field at the intersection of ML algorithms and low-cost embedded systems. TinyML enables on-device analysis of sensor data (vision, audio, IMU, etc.) at ultra-low-power consumption (<1mW). Processing data close to the sensor allows for an expansive new variety of always-on ML use-cases that preserve bandwidth, latency, and energy while improving responsiveness and maintaining privacy. This talk introduces the vision behind TinyML and showcases some of the interesting applications that TinyML is enabling in the field, from wildlife conservation to supporting public health initiatives. Yet, there are still numerous technical hardware and software challenges to address. Tight memory and storage constraints, MCU heterogeneity, software fragmentation and a lack of relevant large-scale datasets pose a substantial barrier to developing TinyML applications. To this end, the talk touches upon some of the research opportunities for unlocking the full potential of TinyML."

      title: "A vision for interactive model development: efficient machine learning by bringing domain experts in the loop"
      abstract: "Building computer vision models today is an exercise in patience--days to weeks for human annotators to label data, hours to days to train and evaluate models, weeks to months of iteration to reach a production model. Without tolerance for this timeline or access to the massive compute and human resources required, building an accurate model can be challenging if not impossible. In this talk, we discuss a vision for interactive model development with iteration cycles of minutes, not weeks. We believe the key to this is integrating the domain expert at key points in the model building cycle and leveraging supervision cues above just example-level annotation. We will discuss our recent progress toward aspects of this goal: judiciously choosing when to use the machine and when to use the domain expert for fast, low label budget model training (CVPR 2021, ICCV 2021), building confidence in model performance with low-shot validation (ICCV 2021 Oral), and some initial tools for rapidly defining correctness criteria."

      title: "Implementing Symbols and Rules with Neural Networks"
      abstract: 'Many aspects of human language and reasoning are well explained in terms of symbols and rules. However, state-of-the-art computational models are based on large neural networks which lack explicit symbolic representations of the type frequently used in cognitive theories. One response has been the development of neuro-symbolic models which introduce explicit representations of symbols into neural network architectures or loss functions. In terms of Marr''s levels of analysis, such approaches achieve symbolic reasoning at the computational level ("what the system does and why") by introducing symbols and rules at the implementation and algorithmic levels. In this talk, I will consider an alternative: can neural networks (without any explicit symbolic components) nonetheless implement symbolic reasoning at the computational level? I will describe several diagnostic tests of "symbolic" and "rule-governed" behavior and use these tests to analyze neural models of visual and language processing. Our results show that on many counts, neural models appear to encode symbol-like concepts (e.g., conceptual representations that are abstract, systematic, and modular), but not perfectly so. Analysis of the failure cases reveals that future work is needed on methodological tools for analyzing neural networks, as well as refinement of models of hybrid neuro-symbolic reasoning in humans, in order to determine whether neural networks'' deviations from the symbolic paradigm are a feature or a bug.'

      title: "Data selection for Data-Centric AI: Data Quality Over Quantity"
      abstract: 'Data selection methods, such as active learning and core-set selection, improve the data efficiency of machine learning by identifying the most informative data points to label or train on. Across the data selection literature, there are many ways to identify these training examples. However, classical data selection methods are prohibitively expensive to apply in deep learning because of the larger datasets and models. This talk will describe two techniques to make data selection methods more tractable. First, "selection via proxy" (SVP) avoids expensive training and reduces the computation per example by using smaller proxy models to quantify the informativeness of each example. Second, "similarity search for efficient active learning and search" (SEALS) reduces the number of examples processed by restricting the candidate pool for labeling to the nearest neighbors of the currently labeled set instead of scanning over all of the unlabeled data. Both methods lead to order of magnitude performance improvements, making active learning applications on billions of unlabeled images practical for the first time.'

      title: "Designing Sustainable Datacenters with and for AI"
      abstract: 'Machine learning has witnessed exponential growth over the recent years. In this talk, we will first explore the environmental implications of the super-linear growth trend of AI from a holistic perspective, spanning data, algorithms, and system hardware. System efficiency optimizations can significantly help reducing the carbon footprint of AI systems. However, predictions show that the efficiency improvements will not be enough to reduce the overall resource needs of AI as Jevon''s Paradox suggests "efficiency increases consumption". Therefore, we need to design our datacenters with sustainability in mind, using renewable energy every hour of every day. Relying on wind and solar energy 24/7 is challenging due to their intermittent nature. To cope with the fluctuations of renewable energy generation, multiple solutions can be applied such as energy storage and carbon aware scheduling for the workloads. In this talk, I will introduce a framework to analyze the multi-dimensional solution space by taking into account the operational and embodided footprint of the solutions and further how AI can be a part of the solution.'

      title: "Efficiently Constructing Datasets for Diverse Datatypes"
      abstract: "Building large datasets for data-hungry models is a key challenge in modern machine learning. Weak supervision frameworks have become a popular way to bypass this bottleneck. These approaches synthesize multiple noisy but cheaply-acquired estimates of labels into a set of high-quality pseudolabels for downstream training. In this talk, I introduce a technique that fuses weak supervision with structured prediction, enabling WS techniques to be applied to extremely diverse types of data. This approach allows for labels that can be continuous, manifold-valued (including, for example, points in hyperbolic space), rankings, sequences, graphs, and more. I will discuss theoretical guarantees for this universal weak supervision technique, connecting the consistency of weak supervision estimators to low-distortion embeddings of metric spaces. I will show experimental results in a variety of problems, including learning to rank, geodesic regression, and semantic dependency parsing. Finally I will present and discuss future opportunities for automated dataset construction."

      abstract: "Deep Learning models have enabled state-of-the-art results across a broad range of applications; however, training these models is extremely time- and resource-intensive, taking weeks on clusters with thousands of expensive accelerators in the extreme case. In this talk, I will describe two ideas that help improve the resource efficiency of model training. In the first half of the talk, I will discuss how pipelining can be used to accelerate distributed training. Pipeline parallelism facilitates model training with lower communication overhead than previous methods while still ensuring high compute resource utilization. Pipeline parallelism also enables the efficient training of large models that do not fit on a single worker; for example, we used pipeline parallelism at Nvidia to efficiently scale training to language models with a trillion parameters on 3000+ GPUs. In the second half of this talk, I will describe how resources in a shared cluster with heterogeneous compute resources (e.g., different types of hardware accelerators) should be partitioned among different users to optimize objectives specified over one or more training jobs. Heterogeneity-aware scheduling can improve various scheduling objectives, such as average completion time, makespan, or cloud computing resource cost, by up to 3.5x."

      title: "Towards Building a Heavy-Tailed Theory of Stochastic Gradient Descent for Deep Neural Networks"
      abstract: "In this talk, I will focus on the 'tail behavior' of SGD in deep learning. I will first empirically illustrate that heavy tails arise in the gradient noise (i.e., the difference between the stochastic gradient and the true gradient). Accordingly, I will propose to model the gradient noise as a heavy-tailed α-stable random vector and accordingly propose to analyze SGD as a discretization of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by a stable process. As opposed to classical SDEs that are driven by a Brownian motion, SDEs driven by stable processes can incur ‘jumps’, which force the SDE (and its discretization) transition from 'narrow minima' to 'wider minima', as proven by existing metastability theory and the extensions that we proved recently. These results open up a different perspective and shed more light on the view that SGD 'prefers' wide minima. In the second part of the talk, I will focus on the generalization properties of such heavy-tailed SDEs and show that the generalization error can be controlled by the Hausdorff dimension of the trajectories of the SDE, which is closely linked to the tail behavior of the driving process. Our results imply that heavier-tailed processes should achieve better generalization; hence, the tail-index of the process can be used as a notion of "capacity metric”. Finally, if time permits, I will talk about the 'originating cause' of such heavy-tailed behavior and present theoretical results which show that heavy-tails can even emerge in very sterile settings such as linear regression with i.i.d Gaussian data."
