      title: "Machine Learning in Production: Review of Empirical Solutions"
      abstract: "As machine learning/inference tasks boil down to comparing or transforming complicated probability distributions, optimal transport (OT) theory---which provides a potent framework for doing so---has emerged as a tool of choice for design and analysis. Its adoption was driven by an array of favorable properties, including robustness to support mismatch, a powerful duality theory, and the Wasserstein metric it defines on the space of probability measures, which endows it with a rich geometry. Alas, statistical OT is bottlenecked by the curse of dimensionality, whereby quantitative results either deteriorate exponentially with dimension or are largely unavailable (e.g., limit theorems, resampling, efficiency). In turn, resulting performance bounds for OT-based learning methods are often vacuous or, worse yet, missing. Slicing is a modern regularization technique by which one computes the average/maximized OT distance between different low-dimensional projections of the high-dimensional distributions. This framework inherits many structural properties of classical OT but alleviates the empirical curse of dimensionality. This talk will present recent advancements in the statistical and computational analysis of sliced OT methods. We will cover fast empirical convergence rates, high-dimensional limit distribution theorems, as well as formal guarantees for computational methods such as Monte Carlo integration (for average-slicing) and projected subgradient methods (for max-slicing). Applications to implicit generative modeling will be discussed and serve to motivate the statistical exploration."

      title: "What can Data-Centric AI Learn from Data and ML Engineering?"
      abstract: 'Data-centric AI is a new and exciting research topic in the AI community, but many organizations already build and maintain various "data-centric" applications whose goal is to produce high quality data. These range from traditional business data processing applications (e.g., "how much should we charge each of our customers this month?") to production ML systems such as recommendation engines. The fields of data and ML engineering have arisen in recent years to manage these applications, and both include many interesting novel tools and processes. In this talk we present lessons from data and ML engineering that could be interesting to apply in data-centric AI, based on our experience developing data and ML platforms that serve thousands of applications at a range of organizations. In particular, we will discuss lessons related to data monitoring and the challenges to apply it effectively in production ML systems.'

      title: "DeepETA: How Uber Predicts Arrival Times Using Deep Learning"
      abstract: "Estimated
 Time of Arrival (ETA) plays an important role in delivery and ride-hailing platforms. For example, Uber uses ETAs to calculate fares, estimate pickup times, match riders to drivers, plan deliveries, and more. Commonly used route planning algorithms predict
 an ETA conditioned on the best available route, but such ETA estimates can be unreliable when the actual route taken is not known in advance. In this talk, we describe an ETA post-processing system in which a deep residual ETA network (DeepETA) refines naive
 ETAs produced by a route planning algorithm. Offline experiments and online tests demonstrate that post-processing by DeepETA significantly improves upon the accuracy of naive ETAs as measured by mean and median absolute error. We further show that post-processing
 by DeepETA attains lower error than competitive baseline regression models."

      title: "Improving Robustness and Interpretability in Vision and Language Grounding Models"
      abstract: 'Deep neural networks have enabled significant progress on many multi-modal grounding problems such as visual question answering (VQA), referring expression recognition (REF) which has several important applications such as in navigation, medical imaging, robotics and accessibility. In the last few years we have seen a huge improvement in how these models perform, some of them reaching human-level performance on several datasets. However, we find that these models could be exploiting strong biases in these datasets casting doubts on the actual progress. 

      For example, as a human, do you focus on the same visual object when you hear the sentences “the bus in the middle of the crowd” and “the crowd that the bus is in the middle of”? Neural networks do so. The exciting progress on understanding language in the context of an image is not due to the cleverness of the neural networks, but rather because of the shortcuts present in the evaluation datasets. In this talk, we show that state-of-the-art neural network approaches are easily fooled due to their failure in overcoming biases in the training datasets. We also show that the recent self-supervised BERT based multi-modal architectures (e.g. ViLBERT) are relatively more robust compared to other neural architectures. We propose methods to improve robustness (and generalization) of the current models. We show that while data augmentation is one way to increase robustness, multi-task learning is probably a less tedious route. Finally, we describe a mechanism for producing scalable and nonstationary benchmarks (and out-of-distribution hard splits) for testing the generalization capabilities of existing grounding models.'

      title: "Improving Transfer and Robustness of Supervised Contrastive Learning"
      abstract: 'An ideal learned representation should display transferability and robustness. Supervised contrastive learning is a promising method for training accurate models, but produces representations that do not capture these properties due to class collapse -- when all points in a class map to the same representation. In this talk, we discuss how to alleviate these problems to improve the geometry of supervised contrastive learning. We identify two key principles: balancing the right amount of geometric "spread" in the embedding space, and inducing an inductive bias towards subclass clustering. We introduce two mechanisms for achieving these aims in supervised contrastive learning, and show that doing so improves transfer learning and worst-group robustness. Next, we show how we can apply these insights to improve entity retrieval in open-domain NLP tasks (e.g., QA, search). We present a new method, TABi, that trains bi-encoders with a type-aware supervised contrastive loss and improves long-tailed entity retrieval.'

      title: "Learned Indexing and Sampling for Improving Query Performance in Big-Data Analytics"
      abstract: "Traditional data analytics systems improve query efficiency via fine-grained, row-level indexing and sampling techniques. However, to keep up with the data volumes, increasingly many systems store and process datasets in large partitions containing hundreds of thousands of rows. Therefore, these analytics systems must adapt traditional techniques to work with coarse-grained data partitions as a basic unit to process queries efficiently. 
 
      In this talk, I will discuss two related ideas that combine learning techniques with partitioning designs to improve the query efficiency in the analytics systems. First, I will describe PS3, the first approximate query processing system that supports non-uniform, partition-level samples. PS3 reduces the number of partitions accessed by 3 to 70x to achieve the same error compared to a uniform sample of the partitions.  Next, I will present OLO, an online learning framework that dynamically adapts data organization according to changes in query workload to minimize overall data access and movement. We show that dynamic reorganization outperforms a single, optimized partitioning scheme by up to 30% in end-to-end runtime.

      I will conclude by discussing additional open problems in this area."

      title: "Looper: an end-to-end ML platform for product decisions"
      abstract: "Modern software systems and products increasingly rely on machine learning models to make data-driven decisions based on interactions with users, infrastructure and other systems. For broader adoption, this practice must (i) accommodate product engineers without ML backgrounds, (ii) support fine-grain product-metric evaluation and (iii) optimize for product goals. To address shortcomings of prior platforms, we introduce general principles for and the architecture of an ML platform, Looper, with simple APIs for decision-making and feedback collection.
      
      Looper covers the end-to-end ML lifecycle from collecting training data and model training to deployment and inference, and extends support to personalization, causal evaluation with heterogenous treatment effects, and Bayesian tuning for product goals. During the 2021 production deployment Looper simultaneously hosted 440-1,000 ML models that made 4-6 million real-time decisions per second. We sum up experiences of platform adopters and describe their learning curve."

      abstract: "Alpa (https://github.com/alpa-projects/alpa) automates model-parallel training of large deep learning models by generating execution plans that unify data, operator, and pipeline parallelism. Alpa distributes the training of large deep learning models by viewing parallelisms as two hierarchical levels: inter-operator and intra-operator parallelisms. Based on it, Alpa constructs a new hierarchical space for massive model-parallel execution plans. Alpa designs a number of compilation passes to automatically derive the optimal parallel execution plan in each independent parallelism level and implements an efficient runtime to orchestrate the two-level parallel execution on distributed compute devices. Alpa generates parallelization plans that match or outperform hand-tuned model-parallel training systems even on models they are designed for. Unlike specialized systems, Alpa also generalizes to models with heterogeneous architectures and models without manually-designed plans."

      title: Scaling Multilingual Machine Translation to Thousands of Language Directions
      abstract: "Existing work in translation has demonstrated the potential of massively multilingual machine translation by training a single model able to translate between any pair of languages. However, much of this work is English-Centric by training only on data which was translated from or to English. While this is supported by large sources of training data, it does not reflect translation needs worldwide. In this talk, I will describe how we create a true Many-to-Many multilingual translation model that can translate directly between any pair of 100 languages. We build and open source a training dataset that covers thousands of language directions with supervised data, created through large-scale mining. Then, we explore how to effectively increase model capacity through a combination of dense scaling and language-specific sparse parameters to create high quality models. Our focus on non-English-Centric models brings gains of more than 10 BLEU when directly translating between non-English directions while performing competitively to the best single systems of WMT."

Processing data close to the sensor allows for an expansive new variety of always-on ML use-cases that preserve bandwidth, latency, and energy while improving responsiveness and maintaining privacy. This talk introduces the vision behind TinyML and showcases some of the interesting applications that TinyML is enabling in the field, from wildlife conservation to supporting public health initiatives. Yet, there are still numerous technical hardware and software challenges to address. Tight memory and storage constraints, MCU heterogeneity, software fragmentation and a lack of relevant large-scale datasets pose a substantial barrier to developing TinyML applications. To this end, the talk touches upon some of the research opportunities for unlocking the full potential of TinyML."

      title: "A vision for interactive model development: efficient machine learning by bringing domain experts in the loop"
      abstract: "Building computer vision models today is an exercise in patience--days to weeks for human annotators to label data, hours to days to train and evaluate models, weeks to months of iteration to reach a production model. Without tolerance for this timeline or access to the massive compute and human resources required, building an accurate model can be challenging if not impossible. In this talk, we discuss a vision for interactive model development with iteration cycles of minutes, not weeks. We believe the key to this is integrating the domain expert at key points in the model building cycle and leveraging supervision cues above just example-level annotation. We will discuss our recent progress toward aspects of this goal: judiciously choosing when to use the machine and when to use the domain expert for fast, low label budget model training (CVPR 2021, ICCV 2021), building confidence in model performance with low-shot validation (ICCV 2021 Oral), and some initial tools for rapidly defining correctness criteria."

      title: "Implementing Symbols and Rules with Neural Networks"
      abstract: 'Many aspects of human language and reasoning are well explained in terms of symbols and rules. However, state-of-the-art computational models are based on large neural networks which lack explicit symbolic representations of the type frequently used in cognitive theories. One response has been the development of neuro-symbolic models which introduce explicit representations of symbols into neural network architectures or loss functions. In terms of Marr''s levels of analysis, such approaches achieve symbolic reasoning at the computational level ("what the system does and why") by introducing symbols and rules at the implementation and algorithmic levels. In this talk, I will consider an alternative: can neural networks (without any explicit symbolic components) nonetheless implement symbolic reasoning at the computational level? I will describe several diagnostic tests of "symbolic" and "rule-governed" behavior and use these tests to analyze neural models of visual and language processing. Our results show that on many counts, neural models appear to encode symbol-like concepts (e.g., conceptual representations that are abstract, systematic, and modular), but not perfectly so. Analysis of the failure cases reveals that future work is needed on methodological tools for analyzing neural networks, as well as refinement of models of hybrid neuro-symbolic reasoning in humans, in order to determine whether neural networks'' deviations from the symbolic paradigm are a feature or a bug.'

      title: "Data selection for Data-Centric AI: Data Quality Over Quantity"
      abstract: 'Data selection methods, such as active learning and core-set selection, improve the data efficiency of machine learning by identifying the most informative data points to label or train on. Across the data selection literature, there are many ways to identify these training examples. However, classical data selection methods are prohibitively expensive to apply in deep learning because of the larger datasets and models. This talk will describe two techniques to make data selection methods more tractable. First, "selection via proxy" (SVP) avoids expensive training and reduces the computation per example by using smaller proxy models to quantify the informativeness of each example. Second, "similarity search for efficient active learning and search" (SEALS) reduces the number of examples processed by restricting the candidate pool for labeling to the nearest neighbors of the currently labeled set instead of scanning over all of the unlabeled data. Both methods lead to order of magnitude performance improvements, making active learning applications on billions of unlabeled images practical for the first time.'

      abstract: 'Machine learning has witnessed exponential growth over the recent years. In this talk, we will first explore the environmental implications of the super-linear growth trend of AI from a holistic perspective, spanning data, algorithms, and system hardware. System efficiency optimizations can significantly help reducing the carbon footprint of AI systems. However, predictions show that the efficiency improvements will not be enough to reduce the overall resource needs of AI as Jevon''s Paradox suggests "efficiency increases consumption". Therefore, we need to design our datacenters with sustainability in mind, using renewable energy every hour of every day. Relying on wind and solar energy 24/7 is challenging due to their intermittent nature. To cope with the fluctuations of renewable energy generation, multiple solutions can be applied such as energy storage and carbon aware scheduling for the workloads. In this talk, I will introduce a framework to analyze the multi-dimensional solution space by taking into account the operational and embodided footprint of the solutions and further how AI can be a part of the solution.'

      title: "Efficiently Constructing Datasets for Diverse Datatypes"
      abstract: "Building large datasets for data-hungry models is a key challenge in modern machine learning. Weak supervision frameworks have become a popular way to bypass this bottleneck. These approaches synthesize multiple noisy but cheaply-acquired estimates of labels into a set of high-quality pseudolabels for downstream training. In this talk, I introduce a technique that fuses weak supervision with structured prediction, enabling WS techniques to be applied to extremely diverse types of data. This approach allows for labels that can be continuous, manifold-valued (including, for example, points in hyperbolic space), rankings, sequences, graphs, and more. I will discuss theoretical guarantees for this universal weak supervision technique, connecting the consistency of weak supervision estimators to low-distortion embeddings of metric spaces. I will show experimental results in a variety of problems, including learning to rank, geodesic regression, and semantic dependency parsing. Finally I will present and discuss future opportunities for automated dataset construction."

      abstract: "Deep Learning models have enabled state-of-the-art results across a broad range of applications; however, training these models is extremely time- and resource-intensive, taking weeks on clusters with thousands of expensive accelerators in the extreme case. In this talk, I will describe two ideas that help improve the resource efficiency of model training. In the first half of the talk, I will discuss how pipelining can be used to accelerate distributed training. Pipeline parallelism facilitates model training with lower communication overhead than previous methods while still ensuring high compute resource utilization. Pipeline parallelism also enables the efficient training of large models that do not fit on a single worker; for example, we used pipeline parallelism at Nvidia to efficiently scale training to language models with a trillion parameters on 3000+ GPUs. In the second half of this talk, I will describe how resources in a shared cluster with heterogeneous compute resources (e.g., different types of hardware accelerators) should be partitioned among different users to optimize objectives specified over one or more training jobs. Heterogeneity-aware scheduling can improve various scheduling objectives, such as average completion time, makespan, or cloud computing resource cost, by up to 3.5x."

      title: "Pixelated Butterfly: Simple and Efficient Sparse Training for Neural Network Models"
      abstract: "Overparameterized neural networks generalize well but are expensive to train. Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster than the dense MLP-Mixer, Vision Transformer, and GPT-2 medium with no drop in accuracy."

      abstract: "Although theoretical federated learning research is growing exponentially, we are far from putting those theories into practice. In this talk, I will share our ventures into building practical systems for two extremities of federated learning. Sol is a cross-silo federated learning and analytics system that tackles network latency and bandwidth challenges faced by distributed computation between far-apart data sites. Oort, in contrast, is a cross-device federated learning system that enables training and testing on representative data distributions despite unpredictable device availability. Both deal with systems and network characteristics in the wild that are hard to account for in analytical models. I'll then share the challenges in systematically evaluating federated learning systems that have led to a disconnect between theoretical conclusions and performance in the wild. I'll conclude this talk by introducing FedScale, which is an extensible framework for evaluation and benchmarking in realistic settings to democratize practical federated learning for researchers and practitioners alike. All these systems are open-source and available at https://github.com/symbioticlab."

      title: "Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces"
      abstract: "A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies.  Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of 10000 or more steps.  We introduce a simple sequence model based on the fundamental state space representation $x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t)$ and show that it combines the strengths of several model families.  Furthermore, we show that the HiPPO theory of continuous-time memorization can be incorporated into the state matrix $A$, producing a class of structured models that handles long-range dependencies mathematically and can be computed very efficiently.  The Structured State Space (S3) model achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation 60X faster, (iii) SotA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors."

      title: "Data-efficient and Robust Learning from Massive Datasets"
      abstract: "Large datasets have been crucial to the success of modern machine learning models. However, training on massive data has two major limitations. First, it is contingent on exceptionally large and expensive computational resources, and incurs a substantial cost due to the significant energy consumption. Second, in many real-world applications such as medical diagnosis, self-driving cars, and fraud detection, big data contains highly imbalanced classes and noisy labels. In such cases, training on the entire data does not result in a high-quality model.  

In this talk, I will argue that we can address the above limitations by developing techniques that can identify and extract the representative subsets for learning from massive datasets. Training on representative subsets not only reduces the substantial costs of learning from big data, but also improves their accuracy and robustness against noisy labels. I will discuss how we can develop theoretically rigorous techniques that provide strong guarantees for the quality of the extracted subsets, as well as the learned models’ quality and robustness against noisy labels. I will also show the effectiveness of such methods in practice for data-efficient and robust learning."

      abstract: "In modern AI, large-scale deep learning models have emerged as the core technology behind many important Internet businesses, such as Search/ADs/Recommendation System/CV/NLP. BERT, Vision Transformer, GPT-3, and Switch Transformer models scale up the model size to a billion or even trillion number of parameters, showing non-trivial accuracy improvement for nearly all learning tasks. Distributed training using cloud clusters is key to the successful training of such large-scale models in a timely manner. Developing more advanced distributed training systems and algorithms can either reduce the energy cost or enable us to train even larger models. Furthermore, it is also essential to develop disruptive learning paradigms like federated learning, which can not only protect the privacy of users but also distribute the burden of handling unprecedented big data and models.

This talk will mainly focus on distributed ML systems for large-scale models: dynamic distributed training for the cloud cluster (https://DistML.ai) and scale federated learning for the edge devices (https://FedML.ai). In the first part, I will introduce PipeTransformer, an automated elastic pipelining for distributed training of Transformer models (BERT and ViT). In PipeTransformer, we design an adaptive on the fly freeze algorithm that can identify and freeze some layers gradually during training, and an elastic pipelining system that can dynamically reduce GPU resources to train the remaining active layers, and also forks more pipelines on released GPU resources to enlarge the width of data parallelism.

      abstract: "Binary program analysis is a fundamental building block for a broad
spectrum of security tasks. Essentially, binary analysis encapsulates
a diverse set of tasks that aim to understand and analyze
behaviors/semantics of binary programs. Existing approaches often
tackle each analysis task independently and heavily employ ad-hoc
task-specific brittle heuristics. While recent ML-based approaches
have shown some early promise, they too tend to learn spurious
features and overfit to specific tasks without understanding the
underlying program semantics.

In this talk, I will describe two of our recent projects that use
transfer learning to learn binary program semantics and transfer the
learned knowledge for different binary analysis tasks. Our key
observation is that by designing a pretraining task that can learn
binary code semantics, we can drastically boost the performance of
binary analysis tasks. Our pretraining task is fully self-supervised
-- it does not need expensive labeling effort and therefore can easily
generalize across different architectures, operating systems,
compilers, optimizations, and obfuscations. Extensive experiments show
that our approach drastically improves the performance of popular
tasks like binary disassembly and matching semantically similar binary
functions."

      title: "Assorted boring problems in distributed machine learning"
      abstract: "Much of the academic focus on “distributing/scaling up machine learning” is synonymous with “training larger supervised ML models like GPT-3 with more and more compute resources”. However, training is only a small part of the ML lifecycle. In this talk, I’ll focus on a couple other machine learning problems that demand a large amount of compute resources, which may be a bit more “boring” but equally (or arguably more!) important. I’ll cover a couple problems that my collaborators and I have previously worked on at UC Berkeley and now at Anyscale: abstractions for scalable reinforcement learning and building RLlib (ICML 18, ICLR 20), distributed hyperparameter tuning and dynamic resource allocation for hyperparameter tuning (SOCC 19, Eurosys 21), and ray as a substrate for the next generation of ML platforms."

      title: "Deep Learning Based Recommender Systems in Production"
      abstract: "Recommender Systems are one of the most complex ML applications to deploy into production.  The data is sparse, massive, and constantly increasing, and the models deployed create a feedback loop that requires careful monitoring.  What's more, the hardware and software that led to the revolution of deep learning was built during the era of computer vision.  Differences in architecture and data between vision and recommenders initially made the HW/SW stack a poor fit for deep learning based recommender systems.  In this talk we'll explore what makes recommenders different from a data, architecture, and system perspective, and talk about changes in GPU hardware within the last generation that make it much better suited to the recommendation problem.  By focusing on these differences we've also identified improvements on the software side that take advantage of optimizations only possible in the recommendation domain.  A new era of faster ETL, Training and Inference is coming to the RecSys space and this talk will walk through some of the patterns of optimization that guide the tools we're building to make recommenders both faster to use and easier to deploy on GPUs."

      title: "Towards Instance-Optimized Data Systems"
      abstract: "Recently, there has been a lot of excitement around ML-enhanced (or learned) algorithm and data structures. For example, there has been work on applying machine learning to improve query optimization, indexing, storage layouts, scheduling, log-structured merge trees, sorting, compression, sketches, among many other things. Arguably, the motivation behind these techniques are similar: machine learning is used to model the data and/or workload in order to derive a more efficient algorithm or data structure. Ultimately, what these techniques will allow us to build are “instance-optimized” systems; systems that self-adjust to a given workload and data distribution to provide unprecedented performance and avoid the need for tuning by an administrator.
In this talk, I will provide an overview of the opportunities and limitations of learned index structures, storage layouts, and query optimization techniques we have been developing in my group, and how we are integrating these techniques to build a first instance-optimized database system."

      title: "Disruptive Research on Distributed ML Systems"
      abstract: "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) enable computers to excel across many different applications such as image classification, speech recognition and robotics control. To accelerate DNN training and serving, parallel computing is widely adopted. System efficiency is a big issue when scaling out. In this talk, I will make three arguments towards better system efficiency in distributed DNN training and serving.

First, Ring All-Reduce for model synchronization is not optimal, but Blink is. By packing spanning trees rather than forming rings, Blink achieves higher flexibility in arbitrary networking environments and provides near-optimal network throughput. Blink is filed as a US patent and is being used by Microsoft. Blink gains lots of attention from industry, such as Facebook (distributed PyTorch team), ByteDance (parent company of TikTok app). Blink was also featured on Nvidia GTC China 2019 and news from Baidu, Tencent.

Second, communication can be eliminated via sensAI's class parallelism. sensAI decouples a multi-task model into disconnected subnets, each is responsible for decision making of a single task. sensAI's attribute of low-latency, real-time model serving attracts several Venture Capitals in the Bay Area.

Third, Wavelet is more efficient than gang-scheduling. By intentionally adding task launching latency, Wavelet interleaves peak memory usage across different waves of training tasks on the accelerators, and thus it improves both computation and on-device memory utilization. Multiple companies, including Facebook and Apple, show interests to Wavelet project."

Today,  with the ever more long documents and  multimedia data, finding the right information is more important and challenging than ever. The rise of deep learning has ushered in a new era of neural search. However, building a neural search system is non-trivial for researchers and engineers. While neural search has long held a significant promise, the advantages of open source combined with recent advances in deep learning now provides us a framework to make the next generation of search technology a reality.

      abstract: "Database management systems (DBMSs) are an important part of modern data-driven applications. However, they are notoriously difficult to deploy and administer. There are existing methods that recommend physical design or knob configurations for DBMSs. But most of them require humans to make final decisions and decide when to apply changes. The goal of a self-driving DBMS is to remove the DBMS administration impediments by managing itself autonomously. In this talk, I present the design of a new self-driving DBMS (NoisePage) that enables such automatic system management. I first discuss a forecasting framework that uses unsupervised clustering and ensemble ML models to efficiently predict the query arrival rates under varying database workload patterns. I then describe NoisePage's modeling framework that constructs and maintains ML models to predict the behavior of self-driving DBMS actions: the framework decomposes the DBMS architecture into fine-grained operating units to estimate the system's behavior under unseen configurations. I then introduce our ongoing work for an action planning framework that makes explainable decisions based on the forecasted workload and the modeled behavior. Lastly, I explain how we integrate all the self-driving components into the system."

      abstract: "Hand-crafted neural architecture design has played a major role in accelerating progress in computer vision, resulting in effective backbones like ResNet. Unfortunately, these convolutional backbones are not as effective in other domains. Successfully transferring existing architectures to applications such as sequence modeling, learning on graphs, or solving partial differential equations has required the manual design of task-specific neural operations to replace convolutions. In this talk, we will first motivate the problem of 'automating architecture transfer' to enable users to find the right operations given data from their specific domain. We will next present our ongoing work on this problem, by introducing a family of neural operations called 'XD-Operations' that mimic the inductive bias of multichannel convolutions while being much more expressive, provably containing numerous well-known operations. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of XD-operations on a diverse set of applications---in some cases outperforming the latest neural operation designs."

In this talk I will discuss challenges we've faced in the iterative process of curating data, training models, and validating models for the specific case of rare events and categories in image and video collections.  In this regime we've found that conventional wisdom about training on imbalance data sets, and data acquisition via active learning does not lead to the most efficient solutions.  I'll discuss these challenges in the context of image and video analysis applications, and elaborate on our ongoing vision of how a grad student, armed with massive amounts of unlabeled video data, pretrained models, and available-in-seconds-supercomputing-scale elastic compute should be able to interactively iterate on cycles of acquiring training data, training models, and validating models."

      title: "Scalable Bayesian Optimization for Industrial Applications"
      abstract: "Bayesian optimization has become a powerful method for the sample-efficient optimization of expensive black-box functions. These functions do not have a closed-form and are evaluated for example by running a complex economic simulation, by an experiment in the lab or in a market, or by a CFD simulation.  Use cases arise in machine learning, e.g., when tuning the configuration of an ML model or when optimizing a reinforcement learning policy.  Examples in engineering include the design of aerodynamic structures or materials discovery.
In this talk I will introduce the key ideas of Bayesian optimization and discuss how they can be applied to tuning ML models.  Moreover, I will share some experiences with developing a Bayesian optimization service in industry.

      title: "JAX: accelerating machine learning research by composing function transformations in Python"
      abstract: "JAX is a system for high-performance machine learning research and numerical computing. It offers the familiarity of Python+NumPy together with hardware acceleration, plus a set of composable function transformations: automatic differentiation, automatic batching, end-to-end compilation (via XLA), parallelizing over multiple accelerators, and more. JAX's core strength is its guarantee that these user-wielded transformations can be composed arbitrarily, so that programmers can write math (e.g. a loss function) and transform it into pieces of an ML program (e.g. a vectorized, compiled, batch gradient function for that loss).

JAX had its open-source release in December 2018 (https://github.com/google/jax). It's used by researchers for a wide range of applications, from studying training dynamics of neural networks, to probabilistic programming, to scientific applications in physics and biology."

      title: "Principles of Good Machine Learning Systems Design"
      abstract: "This talk covers what it means to operationalize ML models. It starts by analyzing the difference between ML in research vs. in production, ML systems vs. traditional software, as well as myths about ML production.

It then goes over the principles of good ML systems design and introduces an iterative framework for ML systems design, from scoping the project, data management, model development, deployment, maintenance, to business analysis. It covers the differences between DataOps, ML Engineering, MLOps, and data science, and where each fits into the framework. It also discusses the main skills each stage requires, which can help companies in structuring their teams.

The talk ends with a survey of the ML production ecosystem, the economics of open source, and open-core businesses."

      title: "Programmatically Building & Managing Training Data with Snorkel"
      abstract: "One of the key bottlenecks in building machine learning systems is creating and managing the massive training datasets that today's models require. In this talk, I will describe our work on Snorkel (snorkel.org), an open-source framework for building and managing training datasets, and describe three key operators for letting users build and manipulate training datasets: labeling functions, for labeling unlabeled data; transformation functions, for expressing data augmentation strategies; and slicing functions, for partitioning and structuring training datasets.  These operators allow domain expert users to specify machine learning (ML) models entirely via noisy operators over training data, expressed as simple Python functions---or even via higher level NL or point-and-click interfaces---leading to applications that can be built in hours or days, rather than months or years, and that can be iteratively developed, modified, versioned, and audited. I will describe recent work on modeling the noise and imprecision inherent in these operators, and using these approaches to train ML models that solve real-world problems, including recent state-of-the-art results on benchmark tasks and real-world industry, government, and medical deployments."

      title: "On Heterogeneity in Federated Settings"
      abstract: "A defining characteristic of federated learning is the presence of heterogeneity, i.e., that data and compute may differ significantly across the network. In this talk I show that the challenge of heterogeneity pervades the machine learning process in federated settings, affecting issues such as optimization, modeling, and fairness. In terms of optimization, I discuss FedProx, a distributed optimization method that offers robustness to systems and statistical heterogeneity. I then explore the role that heterogeneity plays in delivering models that are accurate and fair to all users/devices in the network. Our work here extends classical ideas in multi-task learning and alpha-fairness to large-scale heterogeneous networks, enabling flexible, accurate, and fair federated learning."

      title: "Machine Learning at Industrial Scale: Lessons from the MLflow Project"
      abstract: "Although enterprise adoption of machine learning is still early on, many enterprises in all industries already have hundreds of internal ML applications. ML powers business processes with an impact of hundreds of millions of dollars in industrial IoT, finance, healthcare and retail. Building and operating these applications reliably requires infrastructure that is different from traditional software development, which has led to significant investment in the construction of “ML platforms” specifically designed to run ML applications. In this talk, I’ll discuss some of the common challenges in productionizing ML applications based on experience building MLflow, an open source ML platform started at Databricks. MLflow is now the most widely used open source project in this area, with over 2 million downloads a month and integrations with dozens of other products. I’ll also highlight some interesting problems users face that are not covered deeply in current ML systems research, such as the need for “hands-free” ML that can train thousands of independent models without direct tuning from the ML developer for regulatory reasons, and the impact of privacy and interpretability regulations on ML. All my examples will be based on experience at large Databricks / MLflow customers."
